## Chapters Overview 📚

### Chapter 1 & 2: Text Tokenization ✂️
- **Goal**: Learn how to split text into tokens using Python's `re` library.
- **Key Takeaway**: Tokenization is the foundation of text processing for LLMs.

### Chapter 3: Recap and Preparation 📝
- **Goal**: Summarize previous learnings and prepare for the implementation of the GPT model.
- **Key Takeaway**: Setting the stage for a deeper understanding of GPT-like architectures.

### Chapter 4: Building a Simplified GPT Model 🧩
- **Goal**: Implement a `DummyGPTModel` class using PyTorch.
- **Key Takeaway**: Understand the architecture of GPT models and how they process input.

## Learning Goals 🎯

1. **Understand the Basics**: Learn tokenization, text representation, and model architecture.
2. **Build and Train a GPT Model**: Implement and train a simple GPT-like model.
3. **Experiment and Improve**: Gain insights into model performance and explore potential improvements.
